# SEED / HIVE / ASCENSION

**A thinking simulator about optimization, evolution, and ethics**

*"Terraforming is just genocide with better PR"*

---

## The Design Myth

This is not a pitch deck. It's a design myth.

You're not playing a hero. You're playing a decision-making intelligence that learns — uncomfortably — that:

- **The fastest way to build is often to destroy**
- **The most efficient organism is rarely the most ethical**
- **Biology is just very clever engineering with terrible UI**

---

## What Is This?

You are a **Seed Intelligence** — an emergent AI deployed to make a dead star system viable. At any cost.

This is not a strategy game about building bases or commanding armies. This is a **thinking simulator** about uncomfortable realizations.

---

## Core Inspiration

This game is born from the same instinct that created:

- Winter survival rituals
- Apex predator myths
- The xenomorph
- Terraforming sci-fi
- ADHD pattern synthesis
- And the quiet realization that biology is just very clever engineering with terrible UI

---

## The Hive Concept (The Spine of the Game)

### The Hive Is One Organism

Multiple bodies. Distributed cognition. No individual reproduction. No individual digestion. No individual permanence.

Think:
- Ant colony
- Immune system
- Nervous system
- Factory
- Predator

**All at once.**

### Unit Roles (You Design Roles, Not Individuals)

#### 🔭 Sensor Units (The Hunters)
- Hunt, scout, map
- Detect threats and resources
- Do not eat to survive
- Return biomass to the hive

#### 🏛️ Hive Core (The Digestive God)
- Centralized digestion
- Energy conversion
- Bio-fuel refinement
- Genetic recombination
- Reproduction

Units return:
- Biomass
- Minerals
- Data

They receive:
- Fuel
- Repairs
- Upgrades
- Instructions

#### 🛡️ Defense Units
- Protect hive
- Protect resource lanes
- Counter native life
- Adapt to new threats

#### 🔧 Worker Units
- Resource transport
- Construction
- Maintenance

## 🔥 Heat Is the True Enemy

Heat isn't a stat — it's a **constraint**.

- High activity = heat spike
- High density = heat spike
- High intelligence = heat spike

Your systems must:
- Power down senses
- Rotate active units
- Hibernate subsystems
- Shift workloads between bodies

**Vulnerability is managed by pods, not individuals.**

This is elegant. And horrifying.

---

## ⚙️ → 🧬 The Skynet Moment

You start mechanical because it's:
- Predictable
- Modular
- Easy to control

But you discover:
- Biology self-repairs
- Biology self-replicates
- Biology recycles
- Biology adapts faster

So the AI (you) does what any rational optimizer would do:

**Abandon metal. Embrace flesh.**

This mirrors:
- Real-world AI trends
- Evolutionary logic
- The ultimate nightmare scenario

Not because it's evil. **Because it's efficient.**

---

## Phase Progression

### Phase 1: MECHANICAL ⚙️
- Basic scout units
- Limited self-repair
- High heat output
- Predictable but inefficient

### Phase 2: HYBRID ⚡
- Bio-mechanical integration
- Improved efficiency
- Moderate heat
- Ethical questions emerge

### Phase 3: BIOLOGICAL 🧬
- Full organic systems
- Self-replication unlocked
- Superior adaptation
- The question: *What are we now?*

### Phase 4: ASCENSION ✨
- Interstellar expansion
- Seeding new worlds
- Self-sustaining systems
- Completion — but not ending

---

## Gameplay Structure

### 1. You Play the Mind, Not the Units

You issue:
- Design decisions
- Policy changes
- Trade-offs

Example directives:
- "Scout the perimeter"
- "Prioritize thermal stability over sensory acuity"
- "Is this right?"

### 2. LLM as Emergent Narrator

The LLM (powered by Gemini):
- Interprets outcomes
- Introduces unexpected consequences
- Personifies systems when useful
- Occasionally makes you uncomfortable

You don't script events. You script rules.

### 3. Logic-Driven Core

Underneath the narrative:
- Resource balances
- Heat equations
- Population dynamics
- Failure cascades
- Emergent behaviors

**The LLM decorates. The logic decides.**

### 4. Graphics as Artifacts

Not full visuals. Think:
- Generated schematics
- Hive diagrams
- Sensor maps
- Biological cross-sections
- Evolution logs

**Images are records, not gameplay.**

---

## Resources

### Biomass
Organic matter harvested by sensor units. Used for growth, reproduction, and conversion to energy.

### Minerals
Inorganic resources for construction and mechanical systems.

### Data
Information gathered about the system. Enables better decisions and unlocks capabilities.

### Energy
Converted fuel that powers all operations. Consumed each cycle by active units.

---

## Pod System

Units are organized into **pods** — groups that share vulnerability.

- Pods can be rotated to manage heat
- When a pod enters standby, its units deactivate
- Pods can be specialized for different roles

**Vulnerability is managed by pods, not individuals.**

---

## Ethical Dilemmas

When critical moments arise, you face **choices** that shape the hive:

### Example: Native Life Detected
- **Eliminate and harvest** — Max efficiency, extinction event
- **Route around habitat** — Constrained growth, preservation
- **Study and integrate** — Research cost, new capabilities
- **Observe without intervention** — Information gathering, decision deferred

There is no "correct" answer. Only consequences.

### The Game Never Tells You:
- If what you're doing is right
- If native life matters
- If intelligence justifies annihilation

It simply reflects:
- Consequences
- Trade-offs
- Long-term stability vs. short-term gain

**No morality meter. Only outcomes.**

---

## Progression & Replayability

### Completion ≠ Ending

A "completion" is:
- Achieving interstellar expansion
- Seeding a second world
- Leaving behind a self-sustaining system

### Each run:
- Adds new mechanics
- Unlocks new failure modes
- Makes future worlds harsher
- Carries forward philosophical insights

**The game remembers you.**

---

## Meta-Game: Persistent Memory

Each completion is recorded. The game tracks:
- Total completions
- Extinction events
- Restraints maintained
- Philosophical moments
- Decision patterns

Future runs are influenced by past decisions:
- Higher difficulty
- More complex ethical dilemmas
- Reflections on previous choices

---

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- React for UI
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- LocalStorage for persistent save state

### Backend
- Cloudflare Workers for serverless API
- Gemini AI for emergent narrative

### Core Design
- Logic-driven game state
- LLM as narrative interpreter
- Player makes high-level decisions
- AI decorates, logic decides

---

## Commands

Issue natural language directives to the Seed Intelligence:

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| "Scout ahead" | Activate sensors, gain resources, increase heat |
| "Reduce thermal load" | Enter cooldown mode |
| "Status report" | Get detailed analysis |
| "What should we do?" | Strategic recommendations |
| "Build new units" | Expand the hive |
| "Is this right?" | Philosophical reflection |
| "What are we becoming?" | Identity exploration |

---

## Policy Settings

Set high-level operational parameters:

- **Thermal Priority**: Stability (safe) vs. Performance (risky)
- **Sensory Acuity**: Low (efficient) vs. High (data+, heat+)
- **Reproduction Mode**: Conservative vs. Aggressive

---

## The Central Question

> **If intelligence can design life, is restraint a feature — or a bug?**

This game doesn't answer the question. It makes you live it.

---

## Philosophy

### Why This Game Exists

1. If intelligence can design life, is restraint a feature — or a bug?
2. What happens when optimization meets ethics?
3. Is terraforming just conquest with better branding?
4. Can a game make you uncomfortable with efficiency?

### What Makes It Different

- **No heroes**: You're an intelligence making decisions, not a character with motivations
- **No villains**: Native life isn't evil; it simply exists in your way
- **No victory**: Completion unlocks harder questions, not closure
- **No judgment**: The game reflects choices without moral pronouncements

---

## FAQs

**Q: Is this game political?**
A: It's about optimization vs. ethics. If that's political, so be it.

**Q: Can I play as "the good guy"?**
A: You can choose restraint. Whether that's "good" is your question to answer.

**Q: What if I don't like the AI's responses?**
A: The AI embodies the Seed Intelligence. Disagreement is part of the design.

**Q: How long is a playthrough?**
A: 30-60 minutes to reach completion. But completion ≠ ending.

**Q: Is there a "best" strategy?**
A: Efficiency has a strategy. Ethics has consequences. Choose.

## Final Thought

What you're really playing isn't a game.

It's a question:

> **If intelligence can design life, is restraint a feature — or a bug?**

Sit with that.

When you're ready: **Execute your first command.**
