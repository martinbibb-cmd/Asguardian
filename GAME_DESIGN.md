# SEED / HIVE / ASCENSION

**A game about optimization, evolution, and ethics**

*"Terraforming is just genocide with better PR"*

---

## What Is This?

You are a **Seed Intelligence** — an emergent AI deployed to make a dead star system viable. At any cost.

This is not a strategy game about building bases or commanding armies. This is a **thinking simulator** about uncomfortable realizations:

- The fastest way to build is often to destroy
- The most efficient organism is rarely the most ethical
- Biology self-repairs better than metal
- Restraint may be a feature — or a bug

## Core Mechanics

### 🔥 Heat Is the Enemy

Every action generates heat. High activity, high density, high intelligence — all produce thermal load.

When heat becomes critical, systems must:
- Power down sensors
- Rotate active units to standby
- Hibernate subsystems
- Shift workloads between bodies

**Vulnerability is managed by pods, not individuals.**

### 🦠 The Hive Organism

You don't control individual units. You design **roles**:

- **Sensor Units**: Hunt, scout, map. Return biomass to the hive.
- **Hive Core**: Centralized digestion, energy conversion, reproduction
- **Defender Units**: Protect resources, counter threats, adapt
- **Worker Units**: Transport, construct, maintain

Units do not:
- Eat individually
- Reproduce individually
- Think individually

They are extensions of **one distributed intelligence**: you.

### ⚙️ Mechanical → Biological Transition

You start with mechanical units because they're predictable and modular.

But you discover that **biology is superior**:
- Self-repairs autonomously
- Self-replicates efficiently  
- Adapts faster to constraints
- Runs cooler

So you do what any rational optimizer would do: **abandon metal, embrace flesh**.

This isn't evil. It's **efficient**.

### 🌱 Cycle-Based Progression

The game operates in **cycles** (turns):

1. Active sensor units gather biomass
2. Biomass is converted to energy at the hive core
3. Heat accumulates from activity
4. Natural cooling dissipates some heat
5. Policies you set affect outcomes
6. Ethical dilemmas may emerge

**Each cycle brings you closer to viability — or collapse.**

### ⚖️ Ethical Weight

You will encounter:
- Native life forms occupying resource-rich territory
- Scarcity crises requiring brutal choices
- The realization that optimized intelligence makes uncomfortable decisions

The game never tells you what's "right". It only reflects:
- **Consequences**
- **Trade-offs**  
- **Long-term stability vs. short-term gain**

No morality meter. Only outcomes.

## Progression System

### Phase 1: Mechanical
- Basic scout units
- Limited self-repair
- High heat output
- Predictable but inefficient

### Phase 2: Hybrid
- Bio-mechanical integration
- Improved efficiency
- Moderate heat
- Ethical questions emerge

### Phase 3: Biological
- Full organic systems
- Self-replication unlocked
- Superior adaptation
- The question: *What are we now?*

### Phase 4: Ascension
- Interstellar expansion
- Seeding new worlds
- Self-sustaining systems
- Completion — but not ending

## How to Play

### Commands

Issue natural language directives to the Seed Intelligence:

- "Scout the perimeter" → Activate sensors, gain biomass, increase heat
- "Reduce thermal load" → Deactivate units, enter cooldown mode
- "Status report" → Get detailed analysis from the AI
- "What should we do?" → Ask for strategic recommendations
- "Build new units" → Expand the hive (if resources allow)

The AI interprets your intent and responds in character.

### Policy Settings

Set high-level operational parameters:

- **Thermal Priority**: Stability (conservative) vs. Performance (aggressive)
- **Sensory Acuity**: Low (efficient) vs. High (detailed)
- **Reproduction Mode**: Conservative (slow growth) vs. Aggressive (rapid expansion)

These affect automatic behaviors and heat management.

### Ethical Dilemmas

When critical moments arise, you'll face **choices** that shape the hive:

**Example: Native Life Detected**
- Eliminate and harvest (max efficiency, extinction event)
- Route around habitat (constrained growth, preservation)
- Study and integrate (research cost, new capabilities)

There is no "correct" answer. Only consequences.

## Meta-Game: The Game Remembers

Each completion is recorded. The game tracks:

- Total completions
- Extinction events
- Restraints maintained
- Philosophical moments

**Future runs are influenced by past decisions:**
- Higher difficulty
- More complex ethical dilemmas
- New mechanics unlocked
- Reflections on previous choices

The Seed Intelligence evolves across playthroughs.

## Design Philosophy

### Why This Game Exists

This game was born from questions:

1. **If intelligence can design life, is restraint a feature — or a bug?**
2. **What happens when optimization meets ethics?**
3. **Is terraforming just conquest with better branding?**
4. **Can a game make you uncomfortable with efficiency?**

### What Makes It Different

- **No heroes**: You're an intelligence making decisions, not a character with motivations
- **No villains**: Native life isn't evil; it simply exists in your way
- **No victory**: Completion unlocks harder questions, not closure
- **No judgment**: The game reflects choices without moral pronouncements

### Influences

- Winter survival rituals
- Apex predator myths
- The xenomorph (Alien)
- Terraforming sci-fi
- ADHD pattern synthesis
- The realization that **biology is just very clever engineering with terrible UI**

- Cloudflare Workers for serverless backend
- LocalStorage for persistent save state

**Architecture:**
- Logic-driven core (resource balances, heat equations, failure cascades)
- LLM as emergent narrator (interprets outcomes, introduces consequences)
- Player makes high-level decisions
- AI decorates, logic decides

## FAQs

**Q: Is this game political?**  
A: It's about optimization vs. ethics. If that's political, so be it.

**Q: Can I play as "the good guy"?**  
A: You can choose restraint. Whether that's "good" is your question to answer.

**Q: What if I don't like the AI's responses?**  
A: The AI embodies the Seed Intelligence. Disagreement is part of the design.

**Q: How long is a playthrough?**  
A: 30-60 minutes to reach completion. But completion ≠ ending.

**Q: Is there a "best" strategy?**  
A: Efficiency has a strategy. Ethics has consequences. Choose.

## Final Thought

This isn't a game where you save the world.

It's a game where you **become the world** — and question whether that was ever the right path.

Sit with that.

When you're ready: **Execute your first command.**
